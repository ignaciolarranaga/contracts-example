# graphql-model

This project represents the GraphQL model used by the application and it is automatically generated from the schema definition.

Use `npm run regenerate` to regenerate the types.

Note:
* Lint and Prettier are not added to this project since all the code is autogenerated.
* No test cases are added because of the same.
